# python-hello_world

Small collection of minimal Python programs used for learning basic scripting and execution in the ALX / Higher Level Programming track.

## Purpose
- Introduce running Python scripts from the command line.
- Demonstrate shebang lines, executable permissions, and simple output.
- Provide tiny examples that print "Hello, World!" and basic variations.

## Contents
- One or more simple Python scripts that print text to stdout.
- Optional executable helper scripts (with `#!/usr/bin/env python3` shebang).
- Short README with run instructions and goals.

(The exact filenames may vary â€” look in this directory for the concrete scripts.)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed (macOS: preinstalled or via Homebrew: `brew install python`).

## Usage
- Run a script directly:
  - python3 script_name.py
- If a script has a shebang and executable bit:
  - chmod +x script_name.py
  - ./script_name.py

Example:
```
python3 hello_world.py
# or
chmod +x hello_world.py
./hello_world.py
```

## Contributing
- Keep examples small and focused.
- Follow PEP 8 for formatting.
- Add a short comment at the top of new scripts explaining their purpose.

## License
Use according to the repository's license. If none specified, assume permissive/educational use.
