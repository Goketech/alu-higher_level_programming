# JavaScript: Objects, Scopes & Closures

This directory contains exercises and scripts focused on JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures. The goal is to deepen your understanding of object-oriented programming, class syntax, inheritance, and advanced JavaScript features such as closures and higher-order functions.
